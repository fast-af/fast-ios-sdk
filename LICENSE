9. Limitation of Liability
‍
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FAST, ITS AFFILIATES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY; OR (B) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), EVEN IF FAST KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10. Modification
‍
Fast may amend these Developer Terms and the documentation and guidelines accompanying the applicable Fast Platform, at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website or communicating it to Developer through Developer's Fast account (each a “Revised Version”). The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Developer’s continued use of and access to the Fast Platform after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes Developer's acceptance of such Revised Version. Any Dispute that arose before the changes will be governed by the terms of service in place when the Dispute arose. 

11. Disputes
‍
11.1. Informal Resolution. Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other party through the notice procedures set forth below. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty days of notice, Developer or Fast may bring a formal proceeding.

‍11.2. Arbitration. Developer and Fast agree to resolve any claims relating to these Developer Terms or the Fast Platform through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth below. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco (CA), or any other location both parties agree to in writing.

‍11.3. Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. Developer can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing legal@fast.co from the email address associated with Developer's Fast account within 30 days of the date Developer created Developer's Fast account, or the Effective Date, whichever is later. However, if Developer agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed Developer to opt out of arbitration, Developer's previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.

‍11.4. Exception to Arbitration. Either party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Fast Platform, breach of Section 5 (“Intellectual Property”), or infringement of intellectual property rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above. Both Developer and Fast consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

‍11.5. NO CLASS ACTIONS. Developer may only resolve disputes with Fast on an individual basis and will not bring a claim in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
‍
12. General
‍
These Developer Terms and the Fast Policies constitute the entire agreement between Developer and Fast with respect to the Fast Platform, and supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to the Fast Platform. Fast's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Developer Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting the parties’ intent as closely as possible. Developer may not assign any rights in these Developer Terms, and any attempt to do so is void. Fast and Developer are not legal partners or agents and intend their relationship to be that of independent contractors. These Developer Terms do not create third party beneficiary rights. Notices to Developer shall be sent to the applicable account email address and are deemed given when sent. Notices to Fast must be sent to Fast Legal at Fast AF, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 349 9th Street, San Francisco, CA, 94103 and are deemed given when received.
